        <h2 style="text-align: center;">2017 in Review</h2>
        <p>
          2017 was an incredibly exciting year for me and one which was full of adventure. Across the board I've grown friendships, memories, skills, and failures. I hope by reading this you can take these memories as goals or stories.

        <h4>Surgery</h4>
        <p>
          Right at the start of 2017 I needed some hernia surgery. The operation was nothing major, but the ordeal took a few days to recover from.

        <h4>Vanlife</h4>

        <p>
          Over the winter of 2016 and early into 2017 I had been following along a few communities on reddit (and other sites, youtube, twitter, etc). One such community was <a href="https://reddit.com/r/vanlife" target="_blank">/r/vanlife</a>, which is a community about people rejecting traditional housing and taking control to live in a van/suv/truck they modify. This is similar, but different from a traditional RV lifestyle as these builds are typically done for a fraction of the cost of an RV.
        </p>
        <p>
          After living in Des Moines, IA for 3 years (in May '17) I was quite bored and frustrated with myself. I knew that moving someplace else was what I needed to do for myself, however I had no idea <i>where</i> to move. As a kid my family was fortunate to have many vacations, but I didn't have much in the way of living experience in those cities/areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around February I recall telling my parents I was "going to live in a van". The conversation was a bit of a shock to my parents, but they didn't have any major qualms after I overly-explained many of the builds, tips and tricks, locations, and working arrangements I had read about.
        </p>
        <p>
          In March I purchased my 2001 Chevy Express 3500 van and began to build out the sides, bed, shelving, and solar. I've <a href="/van">documented the build</a>. Many friends and family members were wise to mention that recording the build would serve as a memory years later.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a van. I had a deadline. I had a couple friends to help me build. I had a bunch of tips and ideas from the internet.<br />
          I didn't have any clear direction of where I'd go or what this would actually be like. Many of the videos about people's first week/month in a van sound simialr. It's compariable to switching cities or jobs, but after a little while you find a groove and everything turns out okay.

        <h4>Colorado</h4>

        <p>
          In 2016 I had taking a good friend, Eileen, and my Saturn Ion to Colorado, Wyoming, Utah for a 10-day car-camping sort of adventure. This trip sparked a fire in me that I love being nomadic, traveling, camping, and finding the unknown. The trip was 3k miles and a blast.
        </p>
        <p>
          May came around and I said goodbye to my apartment, downtown life, family and friends. I was off with the Eileen back to Colorado. If you've never been Colorado is a must visit at some point. Beautiful mountains, lakes, valleys and towns await you.
        </p>
        <p>
          At one such lake and campground outside of Buena Vista, CO the entire trip, my new life, almost ended. One night we left out a bit of hummas and crackers while we were camped by a river ... and that was a bad idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometime overnight I awoke to hear a deep exhale and snort.. This was coming from a bear and the sound was over near Eileen's tent. I froze and laid on my back in silence while I hear the bear walk around her tent a bit and push into it. No sound was coming from Eileen's tent and so I had no idea if she was asleep, injured, or dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several minutes pass (I had no idea how long this entire ordeal actually took) and the bear walks between our tents and faces mine. I can hear him probably 3 feet away from me, but I can't see as my tent cover was on. Looking back I am so glad the bear couldn't see me, because what happened next was a loud violent swipe against my tent. He had swipped the tent and torn a small square hole (about the size of a dollar bill folded in half) in my tent.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>I froze.</strong> My only thought was "this bear will kill me" and I'm stuck in my sleepning bag inside the tent which has a zipper. I wouldn't be able to fight or run without being attacked. Laying absolutely frozen and barely breathing the bear left after what seemed a lifetime. More time I waited as I only heard the bear walk away, but had no idea how far.
        </p>
        <p>
          More minutes pass and I don't hear anything from Eileen. I picture her in my head after she's been attacked by the bear and so I realize we have to get together and make sure we're ok. The safest spot is back in the van probably 100 yards away. Unzipping the tent scared me as I didn't want to signal the bear. Getting out of the tent allowed me to barely see as it was pitch dark outside. Only having my flashlight at the time I shine it at Eileens tent and she's already unzipping (after hearing me). We run to the van and hide inside and wait. That night's sleep barely came.
        </p>
        <p>
          We awoke in the morning to find her tent fully collapsed. The bear had come back and stomped on her tent!
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned several things that night.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Always</strong> tie up your food or put it away in your vehicle.</li>
            <li>We probably could have been loud and scared the bear off. Black bears are often afraid of noise.</li>
            <li>Bear mace wouldn't have helped. (You should still have it though.)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Colorado Part 2</h4>
        <p>
          The bear attack was impactful, but it didn't deter me from the outdoors or traveling. I still strongly wanted this for myself. There's plenty of Colorado left to see and explore. Going on several more hikes really helped me enjoy the outdoors.

            It's important that everyone see the natural world. The formations have our human history and relics within them while also being clues to our future.

            Stopping in Leadville, CO was a blast. The town was prospuring in the 1800's from mining, but has survived today a bit on tourism and holding a few gems. There's a french cafe turned bar at night which has quite the design and fablous people.
