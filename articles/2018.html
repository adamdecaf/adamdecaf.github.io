        <h4>Best of the year</h4>
        <p>
          If you didn't see it during the hurricanes this year there was a new type of visualization for the flood surge that I think will get people to evacuate. There were still <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Atlantic_hurricane_season#Season_effects">116 deaths in the year</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/reader-center/evacuation-hurricane-michael.html">evacuating can cost over $1000 for a family</a>.

          On the plus side, imagine getting this video as a warning on your phone over a text message:

          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q01vSb_B1o0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>

          What if we published AR/VR interactives of where the water level can rise up to on your street? Would it better represent the damage to overlay price tags on damaged buildings and cars? The same could be done for the aftermath of forest fires.

          This is fantastic. It's a full implementation of Pokemon Red in Minecraft, but it's done by essentially copying it bit for bit into Minecraft's representation. That's not only an accurate way to <em>emulate</em> a game (produce the same output with different steps), but it's the exact <em>input</em> of the game cartridge (memory/storage layout) as well.

          Everyone should checkout these last two videos. They offer a view into the possible future world where we have radical medical improvements derived from nature. The studies are promising and small, but over the 2020's there should be a lot more peer-reviewed research published about how the crazy world of plants and fungi can, potentially, solve lots of our major issues.
