          In 2016 I went to colorado twice, once inside the White River National Forest and surrounding areas, while then venturing over to Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming.

        <p>
          Later in 2016 I visited a friend in Fort Collins, CO. I was there for a weekend and went on an overnight hike in Rocky.

          <a href="https://www.visitomaha.com/listings/glenn-cunningham-lake/56922/">Cunningham Lake</a> is a surprising nice place for an rv campground.

        <strong>June - Wisconsion, Indiana, and back to Iowa</strong>
        <br />
        <p>
          The first part of June I was with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stockpotkitchen">Stockpot Kitchen</a> in Madison, WI after meeting them in a Illinois parking lot. They're a traveling free food kitchen that serves hungry people across the country with donated food.
        </p>
        <p>
          We visited a friend in Indiana for a week. It was great to relax in a new city, but I've been itching to get back into the wild.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a week in June I'm back in Iowa for a friends wedding. After that It'll be traveling to Oregon, Washington and more of the West.
